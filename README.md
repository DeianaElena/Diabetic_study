## Title: Prediction of Clinical Risk Factors of Diabetes
The paper "Prediction of Clinical Risk Factors of Diabetes Using Multiple Machine Learning Techniques Resolving Class Imbalance" is used for the diabetic study.


## The project's aim
The aim is to optimize the paper's code, manipulate the dataframe according to the features present in the lab and evaluate dfferences with the paper's conclusions.  

## Content
The folder contains different files that can be open/run separately. 
Here is a list of a brief summary of each file's content:

- 'png', it contains all the neecessary pictures and graphs in png format.

- 'CardiacPrediction_csv', it is the dataset mentioned in the paper and taken from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. 
 
- 'Diabetics Prediction (ML) CV=10', it is the code from this repository [here](https://github.com/AmitHasanShuvo/Prediction-of-Clinical-Risk-Factors-of-Diabetes-Using-ML-Resolving-Class-Imbalance).

- 'Common_features_Diabetics Prediction (ML) CV=10', it is an edited version of the original code, where less features are taken into account, according to the one presents in the Lab. Additionally there is an accuracy and f1 score table for comparison with original code.

- 'RF_common_features_Diabetics Prediction (ML) CV=10 - WIP - Copy', it is similar to the previous file but every model is commented, except for RF. It's used to mainly generate trees in a shorter amount of time. (It needs to be updated with the current features)
- 'CHD  of common_features_based on Diabetics Prediction', it is same as 'Common_features_Diabetics Prediction (ML) CV=10', but in this case we use the feature 'CoronaryHeartDisease' instead of 'Diabetes'.
